  "Round corners and add gradients (UICorner, UIGradient), inset content with UIPadding, and constrain sizing responsively with anchor and min/max size.",
  "Wire a button to show, hide or toggle a panel, then preview the result before exporting.",

          About Roblox GUI Maker
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg text-ink-dim leading-relaxed mb-12">
          Roblox GUI Maker is a free, browser-based visual builder for Roblox
          game interfaces. You design with drag-and-drop, wire up interactive
          buttons, and export clean Luau that runs the moment you paste it into
          Studio — no login required.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink mb-3">Why it exists</h2>
          <p className="text-ink-dim leading-relaxed">
            Building a Roblox GUI by hand means nudging UDim2 offsets, rebuilding
            the same menu patterns every project, and fighting the parts of
            Studio that developers complain about most. Roblox GUI Maker replaces
            that grind with a visual editor that keeps you in control: you stay
            precise, the tool handles the busywork, and the output is code you
            would have written yourself.

            What makes it different
          </h2>
          <p className="text-ink-dim leading-relaxed">
            Most &ldquo;AI makes your GUI&rdquo; tools spit out placeholder
            layouts you then have to clean up. This is the opposite: a precise
            canvas where the exported Luau is clean enough to ship. It recreates
            your GUI with real <code className="text-focus">Instance.new</code>{" "}
            calls and <code className="text-focus">UDim2.fromScale</code>{" "}
            positioning — and if you wired a button to open a panel, the export
            includes that{" "}
            <code className="text-focus">.Activated:Connect</code> handler too.
            Paste it into a LocalScript and it just works.

            The editor runs entirely in your browser. There&rsquo;s no account
            and your designs aren&rsquo;t sent to a server — they live in your
            browser&rsquo;s local storage. The only third-party service is
            privacy-respecting aggregate analytics that measures traffic, never
            your designs. It&rsquo;s built with Next.js and deploys as static
            pages.
