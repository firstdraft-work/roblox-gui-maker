This guide shows both, with Luau you can paste straight into Roblox Studio — and every technique here is built into the visual editor.",

          "Roblox offers several built-in fonts. For a clean modern look: GothamBold or GothamBlack for headings, GothamMedium for body text, and Code for technical labels.",
          "Establish a clear text hierarchy: H1 (titles) at 28–36px, H2 (section headers) at 20–24px, body text at 14–16px, and captions at 11–12px. Stick to these sizes across the entire GUI.",
          "Line height matters more than you think. In Roblox, TextLabel.TextWrapped = true with a generous frame height gives you natural line spacing. Avoid cramming text into tight frames.",
          "For dark backgrounds, use TextColor3 with high brightness (200+). For light backgrounds, use low brightness (30–60). Never use mid-gray text — it is unreadable on both.",

        paragraphs: [
          "UIListLayout is the Roblox equivalent of CSS flexbox. Drop it into a Frame and every child stacks automatically — vertically or horizontally, with configurable padding and alignment.",
          "Use UIPadding on the parent Frame to create consistent margins. A good rule: 16px outer padding, 8–12px between items. This matches modern web design conventions and feels natural to players.",
          "For grids (shops, inventories), use UIGridLayout with CellSize in Scale for responsive columns. UDim2.fromScale(0.3, 0) with a UIAspectRatioConstraint gives you square cells that resize with the parent.",
          "For button rows, use UIListLayout with FillDirection = Horizontal and a small Padding value. Each button gets a fixed Offset width so they stay tap-friendly on mobile.",
        ],
        tip: "If your layout looks cramped, increase UIPadding before increasing the Frame size. White space is free and makes everything more readable.",

        paragraphs: [
          "Roblox players use phones, tablets, desktops, and consoles — sometimes in the same server. Your GUI must work on all of them.",
          "The core principle: use Scale-based sizing for containers and layouts, then add UITextSizeConstraint and UIAspectRatioConstraint for fine control over text and aspect ratios.",
          "For mobile: minimum tap target is 44x44 pixels (Apple HIG standard). Keep buttons at least this size. Use UIListLayout spacing of 8px minimum between tappable elements.",
          "For desktop: you can afford denser layouts with smaller text. But keep the same Scale-based structure so the layout reflows naturally.",
          "Test with the Roblox Studio emulator at 360x640 (phone), 768x1024 (tablet), and 1920x1080 (desktop). If it looks right at all three, it will work everywhere.",

          "Group related elements visually. A Frame with a slightly different BackgroundColor3 and a UICorner creates a card that says 'these items belong together.'",
          "Use consistent spacing between groups (16–24px) and tighter spacing within groups (8–12px). This creates a visual rhythm that players intuitively understand.",

        q: "What is the best font for Roblox GUIs?",
        a: "GothamBold for headings and GothamMedium for body text is the safest modern combination. Avoid legacy fonts like SourceSans — they look dated and have inconsistent rendering across platforms.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I make a Roblox GUI look good on mobile?",
        a: "Use Scale-based sizing, keep tap targets above 44x44 pixels, test at 360x640 resolution, and use UIListLayout for automatic reflow. UITextSizeConstraint prevents text from becoming unreadable on small screens.",
      },
      {
        q: "What colors work best for Roblox GUIs?",
        a: "Dark backgrounds (18, 18, 24) with light text (230, 230, 240) and one accent color (0, 162, 255) give you the best contrast across all screen types. Avoid pure white backgrounds — use off-white instead.",
      },
      {
        q: "Should I use Scale or Offset for Roblox GUI sizing?",
        a: "Use Scale for containers, panels, and layout elements that should resize with the screen. Use Offset for icons, corner radius, and fixed-size details. Never use only Offset — your GUI will break on different screen sizes.",

        q: "How do I center a GUI element in Roblox?",
        a: "Set AnchorPoint to (0.5, 0.5) and Position to UDim2.fromScale(0.5, 0.5). This centers the element on its parent regardless of screen size.",

        q: "What is the difference between UIListLayout and UIGridLayout?",
        a: "UIListLayout stacks children in a single row or column. UIGridLayout arranges children in a grid of rows and columns. Use UIListLayout for button bars and settings lists; use UIGridLayout for item grids and inventory screens.",
